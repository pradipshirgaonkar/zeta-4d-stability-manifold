4D Manifold Stability & Phase-Restoration of Riemann Zeta ZerosAuthor: Pradip KambleResearch Topic: Geometrical Solution to the Riemann Hypothesis through 4D Tunneling and $i^2$ Pressure Scaling.1. OverviewThis project presents a novel computational and physical framework for the Riemann Zeta Function $\zeta(s)$. While traditional number theory focuses on 1D/2D analysis, the Kamble Stability Model treats the function as a dynamical system within a 4-Dimensional manifold.2. Key DiscoveriesA. The "Ball and Base" Stability ModelWe propose that a "Zero" is a state of equilibrium. In our 3D cylindrical mapping:The Base: The origin $(0,0)$ represents the only point of zero kinetic energy.Centrifugal Tilt: Deviations from the critical line (e.g., $\sigma = 0.25$) introduce centrifugal forces that prevent the trajectory (the "Ball") from ever reaching the Base.B. The 4D Tunneling (Quantized Jumps)By analyzing the "Gaps" between zeros (specifically between $n=50$ and $n=51$), we discovered Dimensional Compression. As frequency $t$ increases, the 3D spiral contracts into a singularity, forcing the trajectory through a 4-Dimensional Phase Tunnel.Phase Restoration: The observed "Universal Parallelism" in zero clusters is a result of this tunneling, where the phase undergoes a quantized $n\pi$ rotation, acting as a guided rail for stability.C. The $i^2$ Negative Pressure ScaleWe define the Z-axis of the Zeta space using the property $i^2 = -1$. This represents an Inverted Energy Scale, where increasing $t$ generates "Negative Pressure" that asymptotically flattens the helical curvature into a vertical line of stability.3. Computational ImplementationThe included script zeta_4d_stability.py demonstrates these principles:Trajectory Mapping: Comparison between $\sigma=0.5$ (Stable) and $\sigma=0.25$ (Unstable).Phase DNA Mapping: Using color-density to represent the 4th Dimension.Tunnel Visualization: Highlighting the quantized jumps where 3D geometry collapses into 4D phase-shifts.4.
